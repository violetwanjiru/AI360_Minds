ðŸŸ£ Part 2: Case Study Application

**A. Problem Scope (5 points)**

Problem: A healthcare organization wants to automate diagnosis support using medical imaging data (e.g., chest X-rays) to detect conditions like pneumonia.

Scope:

Data: DICOM images and clinical metadata.

Task: Binary classification (disease present or not).

Constraints: Privacy regulations (e.g., HIPAA), need for explainability, and infrastructure limitations in rural clinics.

**B. Deployment (10 points)**

**Steps:**

Model Packaging: Convert the model using ONNX or TensorFlow SavedModel for deployment.

Infrastructure: Host on cloud (e.g., AWS SageMaker) or Edge devices (e.g., hospital servers).

API Integration: Develop RESTful API to integrate model with clinical software.

Monitoring: Set up automated logging and performance tracking.

Retraining Loop: Schedule periodic retraining with new data to ensure performance.

**C. Optimization (5 points)**

Techniques:

Quantization: Reduce model size and latency.

Pruning: Remove redundant weights to improve inference time.

Caching results for repetitive inputs (if applicable).

Use edge computing to reduce latency and protect data.

ðŸŸ£ **Part 3: Critical Thinking â€“ Ethics & Bias (10 points)**

**Ethical Considerations:**

Bias: Medical datasets often lack diversity, causing underperformance for minority groups.

Fairness: False negatives in diagnosis may disproportionately harm certain populations.

Transparency: Black-box models reduce trust among clinicians and patients.

Data Privacy: Using sensitive health data requires secure storage and strict access controls.

Accountability: Responsibility must be clearly assigned when AI informs medical decisions.

Strategies:

Diverse, representative training datasets.

Bias audits during model validation.

Transparent model explanations using SHAP/LIME.

Clear documentation of limitations and risks.
