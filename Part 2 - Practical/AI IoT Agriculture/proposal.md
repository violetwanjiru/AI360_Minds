This smart agriculture system leverages IoT sensors and AI to provide accurate crop yield predictions and optimize irrigation, potentially increasing productivity and conserving water resources.

## Data Collection & Preprocessing

### Data Sources
1. Local Weather Stations: Provide historical and real-time weather data
2. Satellite Imagery: Offers vegetation indices and crop health information

### Potential Bias
- Seasonal Bias: If data is collected primarily during certain seasons, the model may not generalize well to all growing conditions

### Preprocessing Steps
1. Data Cleaning: Remove outliers and handle missing values
2. Normalization: Scale numerical features to a common range (e.g., 0-1)
3. Time Series Alignment: Ensure all time-series data is properly aligned and resampled to a consistent frequency

## Data Strategy for Smart Agriculture System

### Proposed Data Sources
1. IoT Sensors: As listed in the sensor section
2. Drone Imagery: For high-resolution field mapping
3. Farmer Input: Manual observations and historical farm records
4. Government Agricultural Databases: For regional crop data and soil maps

### Ethical Concerns
1. Data Ownership: Ensuring farmers retain ownership and control over their farm data
2. Algorithmic Transparency: Making the AI decision-making process interpretable to farmers
