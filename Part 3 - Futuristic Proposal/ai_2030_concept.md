# AI-Driven Urban Climate Control (2030 Proposal)

## Problem

Urban areas face rising temperatures and air pollution, impacting health and productivity.

## AI Workflow

- **Data Inputs:** IoT sensors (temperature, air quality, humidity), satellite imagery.
- **Model Type:** Reinforcement learning for dynamic climate control.
- **Process:** AI analyzes real-time data, controls smart cooling systems (green roofs, misting, ventilation).

## Societal Risks & Benefits

- **Benefits:** Improved public health, energy savings, climate resilience.
- **Risks:** Privacy concerns (sensor data), unequal access, system failures.

This solution leverages AI for adaptive, sustainable urban environments.
