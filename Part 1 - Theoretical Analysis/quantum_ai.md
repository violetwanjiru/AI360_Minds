# Q2: Quantum AI vs. Classical AI in Optimization Problems

Classical AI uses algorithms on traditional computers to solve optimization problems, such as route planning or scheduling. These methods, like simulated annealing or genetic algorithms, can become slow or stuck in local optima as problem complexity grows.

Quantum AI leverages quantum computing principles—superposition and entanglement—to process many possibilities simultaneously. Quantum algorithms (e.g., Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm, QAOA) can potentially find better solutions faster for certain complex problems.

**Industries that could benefit most:**
- **Pharmaceuticals:** Faster drug molecule optimization.
- **Finance:** Portfolio optimization and risk analysis.
- **Logistics:** Complex supply chain and routing.
- **Energy:** Grid optimization and resource allocation.

Quantum AI is especially promising for industries facing large-scale, combinatorial optimization challenges.
