ðŸŸ£ **Part 4: Reflection & Workflow Diagram (10 points)**

**Reflection (5 points)**

This assignment deepened my understanding of the full AI lifecycleâ€”from problem scoping to deployment, ethics,
and monitoring. Working through real-world scenarios like medical diagnosis reinforced the importance of aligning
technical choices with societal needs, especially in sensitive domains like healthcare. The integration of 
fairness and bias audits was especially enlightening, emphasizing that AI is not just a technical 
endeavor but a socio-technical system.

4. Evaluation (F1-Score, Confusion Matrix) â†’ 5. Bias Detection (Demographic Stratification) â†’ 
6. Deployment (Cloud API) â†’ 7. Monitoring (Performance Logs, Drift Alerts) â†’ 
8. Retraining (New Data Integration)
