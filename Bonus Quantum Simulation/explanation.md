# Quantum Circuit Simulation Explanation

This quantum circuit demonstrates a simple entanglement between two qubits:

1. **Hadamard Gate (H)**: Applied to qubit 0, creating a superposition state.
2. **CNOT Gate**: Uses qubit 0 as control and qubit 1 as target, entangling the qubits.
3. **Measurement**: Both qubits are measured, collapsing the superposition.

## Accelerating AI with Quantum Computing

Quantum computing can potentially accelerate AI tasks like drug discovery through:

1. **Quantum Machine Learning**: Algorithms that leverage quantum superposition and entanglement for faster pattern recognition and data analysis.
2. **Quantum Chemistry Simulations**: More accurate and efficient modeling of molecular interactions, crucial for drug design.
3. **Optimization Problems**: Solving complex optimization tasks in drug formulation and protein folding.

## Current Limitations

1. **Qubit Stability**: Quantum states are fragile and prone to decoherence.
2. **Error Rates**: High error rates in current quantum processors limit the complexity of practical algorithms.
3. **Scalability**: Challenges in scaling up the number of qubits while maintaining coherence.
4. **Algorithm Development**: Limited number of quantum algorithms that outperform classical counterparts.
5. **Cost and Accessibility**: Quantum hardware is expensive and not widely available.

Despite these limitations, the potential for quantum computing in AI and drug discovery remains promising as the technology continues to advance.
